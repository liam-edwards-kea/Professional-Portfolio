                <h3>My first coded animation</h3>
                <p>My first glances of animation came when we had an assignment to add some Javascript animations to be triggered when buttons were clicked. And then subsequently stoped when the button was pressed again.</p>
                <p>Although a primitive way of animating, it was atleast a starting point. And accompanied by animation principles and theory.</p>

                <h3>Story telling</h3>
                <p>This was the first chance to make up a story from scratch. From the initial sketches to the characteristics and digital design.</p>
                <p>Story telling is someting i've loved since as long as I can remember so I really enjoyed this project.</p>

                <h3>Digital film trailer animations</h3>
                <p>A fun project which had us team up in a group of 5 and work together on creating a coded digital animation for a selected movie trailer.</p>
                <p>We went with E.T as everyone in the group enjoyed the film, and from there we all had our positions. I was the 'suit' of the group and over saw the tasks at hand and helped with whatever I could.</p>
                <p>What we came out with is something that we are all proud of at such an early point in our education.</p>

                <p>This was such an awesome project to start with after a month off. I've been a gamer my whole life so the idea of making a game was really exciting to me.</p>
                <p>It didn't take long before I was addicted to unity and making this whole environment for my player. We just had the week to do the project but I could have done this for the whole semester.<p>My game is set on a plush green island full of dancing zombies to the tune of a dumbfounded Boris Johnson.</p>
                    <p>I give you.. Boris Zombies.</p>

                <h3>After Effects</h3>
                <p>My first attempt at After Effects and motion graphics was a fun one. With a cool company (Euroman) to work with we had representatives come into uni and pitch to us about what they wanted to see.</p><p>In groups of 3/4 we had a selection of assets we needed to add into a minute or so long motion graphic to sell their new app.</p><p>A great excuse to play around with this new and still foreign adobe programme, we set about adapting our James Bond theme to this project, as he is 'the man' after all.</p><p>Intergrating images we had created on illustrator, we spent a whole day just creating a solution that pleased the clients.</p>
