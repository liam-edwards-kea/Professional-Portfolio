                <h3>Greenpeace</h3>
                <p>This was the first time we had to work with a client, and such an influential and important one at that.</p>
                <p>As a previous student of Environmental Science, the idea of doing a project for an environmentally aware client was awesome.The idea was to create a campaign to catch the attention of young teenage danish kids as the future is in their hands and for them to be aware is important.</p>
                <p>We interviewed children at a Roskilde school and gathered intel for what they might want in a campaign and video. Surprised at what they already knew, which was a lot, we didn't sugar coat the issue and came with a hard hitting campaign and video to match.</p>

            <div class="caption">
                <h3>Huset</h3>
                <p>Another client that we had was the multi-cultural hub of Copenhagen in Huset. I personally love the place and all the different venues so I was familiar with what they are all about.</p>
                <p>As they weren't strictly involved in our process, this was a client where we got to have fun with what was provided to us. This included all their assets in order to make a design guide and furthermore make our sites more linked with Huset's vision a visual identity.</p>

                <h3>UN sustainability goals</h3>
                <p>Again, another environmentally conscious client gave us the opportunity to pick a a sustainability target set by the UN and do some After Effects graphs and some VR A-Frames to hold everything that we made.</p>
                <p>As I love the VR and A-Frame stuff I really went into it again and added a baron landscape to show a dried up earth, as my goal was marine life.</p><p>This was a chance during isolation, to really get stuck into the work as we had nowhere else to go anyway.</p>

                <h3>Musil</h3>
                <p>Musil is a young Copenhagen artist and friend of mine called Mikkel. As our exam project we were to get a client who is an artist, and build a website for them using a backend wordpress with a CMS guide so Musil could populate the website himself whenever he wanted.</p><p>This was the first time we had a client who really din't know what he wanted and no real boundaries on what to do so that was a challenge at first. But became a boost rather than a hindrance after we started going and he loved what we were coming up with.</p><p>Furthermore we had the chance as a group to come up with a nicely displayed and well thought out documentation report.</p>
