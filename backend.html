                <h3>Dynamic web</h3>
                <p>Our introduction to the 2nd semester was straight onto the Javascript train with no return ticket.</p><p>Given a google sheets file full of information that we needed to 'fetch' and make into a dynamic Russian cuisine online restaurant. With some extremely interesting looking food and names to deal with, it was actaully a very fun project and set us up nicely for projects to come.</p>

                <h3>DoggoAdopto</h3>
                <p>This was a really nice project as we had free rein on whatever concept we wanted to pursue. We formed into groups and one of our member had sadly had to give up his dog because it didn't agree with the new little addition to the family.</p><p>This then gave us the idea of making a dog adoption website from content stored in a google sheet remotely. We all went on with the task and really had a lot of enthusiasm for the project as we all love dogs.</p><p>The tutors then went on to give us their blessing, for lack of a better word, to take this idea and actaully go out and see if we could get some funding to get something started. We never went on to do this because of all of us already being busy with work and uni, but the project was a great success.</p>

                <h3>Huset website</h3>
                <p>Another client that we had was the multi-cultural hub of Copenhagen in Huset. I personally love the place and all the different venues so I was familiar with what they are all about.</p><p>I went for a slightly different approach and tailored a site for a 55 year old man.</p><p>Furthermore as a big fan of MusicCafeen myself, I made a site to portray the different gigs on at the venue (making them up, sorry Arctic Monkeys did not play there).</p>
