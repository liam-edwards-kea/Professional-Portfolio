                <h3>My internship at VRDK</h3>
                <p>My first experience as an intern at a augmented reality app based comapny was a great experience in the industry.</p>
                <p>Being employed as a UX/UI designer and content creastor my role was anything from creating the basis of the app design using adobe XD, to creating animations for scannable images</p>
                <p>By this I mean, when the Vileon app was open and it recognised a certain image it would play a video linked with that image</p>
                <p>This meant that I got to work not only for VRDK but also in tandem with companies such as Viaplay, when they were advertsing their new show that was on bus stop boards all over the country.</p>
                <p>The whole experience was challenging but also gave me great sense of how it is to work with other companies in tight time restrictions. As well as providing quality content in that time as well as designing the mobile app in full.</p>

                One of my roles including making videos that would show up when you scanned a certain image using the app Vileon.</p>
                <p>These were done using photoshop to take the scannable image as a base and then creating ideas for how you could alter that image into a video on After Effects.</p>

                <p>The Vileon SoMe channels were always in need of a brush up, wether that be some videos/graphics or help with making videos for linking with other companies </p>
                <p>This is where I cam in when I had no other duties at that time, which included making and editing videos for the competition that was being held in cooperation with Viaplay.</p>
