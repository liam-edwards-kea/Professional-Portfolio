                <h3>My first video edit</h3>
                <p>My first experience of adobe Premier Pro was that it was too heavy for my laptop and I couldn't run it. So yeah, not a good one.</p>
                <p>After borrowing my friends laptop for a few days I spent a lot of time clipping down 7 hours worth of footage to fit the time span of a song, also timed up and in sync with said song.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless as with a lot of these things, once I got into it, it didn't matter how tedious it may have seemed to dig through all this footage</p>
                <p>Our task was to make a microsite and a video to show tourists about the certain aspects of biking in Copenhagen. we chose to focus on the habour circle biking route, which meant one thing; we had to do it.</p>
                <p>So I grabbed a tripod and a goPro and we enjoyed the day like if we were tourists and came up with some fantastic and really genuine footage. A man and a woman, enjoying their day on bicycles and experiencing Copenhagen.</p>

                <p>This was the first time we had to work with a client, and such an influential and important one at that.</p>
                <p>One of the tasks was to create and edit a video to fit our campaign. As a former student of Environmental Science, this one hit close to home and we spared no feelings in our gripping and raw video.</p>

                <p>I explain more about the project in the clients section. Nevertheless the video that we created was a big success with our artistic client and worthy of its seperate section.</p>
                <p>After all there isn't anything much more satisfying than watching a talented individual do what they do best.</p>

                <h3>360 video</h3>
                <p>With access to a fantastic tech lounge, we had the resources to film some nice 360 video.</p>
                <p>In groups again we had an idea planned and me and another classmate went to the kunst museum, only to discover we couldnt film with our 360 camera and big tripod.</p>
                <p>My workplace was not too far away and the idea of a murder happening at the hotel was born.</p>Although the acting left much to be desired, the filming and editing was a fun experience, and the equipment was awesome.

                <h3>Motion graphic video</h3>
                <p>My first attempt at After Effects and motion graphics was a fun one. With a cool company (Euroman) to work with we had representatives come into uni and pitch to us about what they wanted to see.</p>
                <p>In groups of 3/4 we had a selection of assets we needed to add into a minute or so long motion graphic to sell their new app.</p>
                <p>A great excuse to play around with this new and still foreign adobe programme, we set about adapting our James Bond theme to this project, as he is 'the man' after all.</p>
                <p>Intergrating images we had created on illustrator, we spent a whole day just creating a solution that pleased the clients.</p>
